# SweetDream
Final Project of GDM221 – Fundamental for game programming (2/2567) || KMUTT || MDT <br><br>

Core concept<br>
The player takes on the role of a sorcerer who has been cursed to battle their own dreams every night when they fall asleep. If they fail to escape their dream, they will fall into an eternal slumber. Therefore, they must awaken from their own dream and gather resources to purchase magical talismans that grant the player skills, which can be mixed and matched freely. Players can also decorate their bedroom with various items that enhance the character’s power, such as dolls, flowers, ornaments, furniture, and more — all of which increase the character's status. The bedroom thus becomes the center of the character’s power. As a result, the game emphasizes not only combat but also customization as a core aspect.<br><br>

GamePlay<br>
The player can move left and right, dash, jump, use three different skills, and perform normal attacks to defend themselves against monsters. If the monsters deplete the player's HP, it is considered a loss for that round. The player must try to maintain their HP until the designated time, at which point the SweetDream gate will open. Escaping through the gate is considered a victory.<br><br>

Features<br>
Parallax BG: A 2.5D background with multiple layers, where each layer moves at a different speed to create a greater sense of depth and dimension.<br>
